# Bulkrax
Bulkrax is a batteries included importer for Samvera applications. It currently includes support for OAIPMH (DC and Qualified DC) and CSV out of the box. It is also designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily add new importers in to your application or to include them with other gems. Bulkrax provides a full admin interface including creating, editing, scheduling and reviewing imports.


## Installation

### Using the Bulkrax install generator

```ruby
rails generate bulkrax:install
```

### Manual Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bulkrax'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Mount the engine in your routes file

```ruby 
mount Bulkrax::Engine, at: '/'
```


## How it Works
Once you have Bulkrax installed, you will have access to an easy to use interface with which you are able to create, edit, delete, run, and re-run imports and exports. 

Imports can be scheduled to run once or on a daily, monthly or yearly interval. 

Import and export is available to admins via the Importers tab on the dashboard. Export currently supports CSV only.

### View List of Importers
From the admin dashboard, select the "Importers" tab. You will see a list of previously created importers with details of last run, next run, number of records enqueued and processed, failures, deleted upstream records, and total records. From this page you can create a new importer, edit an importer or delete an importer.
